"# tv-script-generation" 
This program uses a recurrent neural netowrk to generate a TV script for a scene from the Simpons TV show, specifically a scene at Moe's Tavern. It uses a recurrent neural network with two hidden layers and 256 LSTM (long short term memory) cells in each hidden layer. This model is built and trained using the python Tensorflow library. The network is trained on scripts from 27 seasons of the Simpsons provided by Kaggle. The network is trained to generate the scene using a starting word of one of the character's names and predicts which word is likely to appear next. The network outputs a probability of each word appearing next given the previous state of the model. The next word is randomly chosen based on the probabilities created from the network. Randomly choosing the word (rather than choosing the word with the highest probability) prevents the same word to appear twice in a row. This network was train using a GPU through Amazon Web Services and ran for 250 epochs.
